/*
 *  Reuser.h
 *
 *  Base class for memory reusing. All classes which inherit from Reuser must have "next" member
 *  and will have overloaded new and delete (BUT NOT new[] and delete[]) operators. The new operator
 *  will try to reuse memory from deleted objects form that class. At least the end of the program
 *  you should call Class::deallocate() for all Reuser-derived classes. Performance can increase up
 *  to 100%.
